# Agent for Bazar Blot
The game Bazar Blot is a very popular game originating in France and making itâ€™s way into Armenia with heavy modifications.
In this repository you can find a [paper](https://duckduckgo.com) throughly explaining the rules, which are very complex and barelu fit in 4-5 pages requiring a lot of effort and experience to fully understand them.
The agents for the game available now are generally accepted to be very bad at the game, while reading the [paper](https://duckduckgo.com) we hope it will be
apparent why that is the case. In order to demonstrate the agents we also made the
game using Python that entirely runs inside a terminal which is available in this repository.
